                            SIDS face several economic, social, and environmental challenges owing to their geophysical and
                            structural constrains. Most of these countries are prone to disastrous effects of climate change
                            while facing unique development challenges such as remoteness to global markets, poor
                            connectivity, lack of economies of scale, and inadequate labour-mobility. Resilient,
                            sustainable, and inclusive infrastructure plays a key role in addressing these challenges and
                            driving sustainable development in SIDS. Given their high-risk exposure, a necessary condition
                            for bridging the infrastructure gap in SIDS is the availability of technical and institutional
                            capacities to ensure that investments in infrastructure systems systematically manage current
                            and future risks by incorporating appropriate measures.

                                IRIS will have a simple and transparent process for providing technical support and meeting the demands of SIDS. The Project Management Unit (PMU) will facilitate the development of projects based on the requests from SIDS through the introduction of a standardised template. The requesting country will need to assign a nodal government agency for coordinating the proposals at the country level. The proposals will be considered by the Steering Committee for approval with technical support from the technical advisory panel, where necessary. Upon project approval, the PMU will coordinate and provide implementation support to SIDS.

The individual projects will be initiated based on the demands and requests of SIDS and will be aligned with SIDS national priorities and planning. Delivering on the three outcomes of IRIS, the projects will include national risk and resilience assessment for infrastructure, post disaster infrastructure assessments, business continuity planning for infrastructure provisioning, integrating resilience in infrastructure standards, forging partnerships with academia for research on resilient and inclusive infrastructure, etc.

                            Following the formal announcement, IRIS will move to a one-year inception period to further refine the operational arrangements required for implementing programmes and activities and start operating by the middle of 2022. During the inception year, IRIS will focus on establishing structures including the Project Management Unit (PMU) and the regional hubs; drafting a comprehensive monitoring, evaluation, and learning (MEL) framework; commissioning initial research; and initiating pilot programmes in 1-2 SIDS. The initial phase of IRIS will be until 2030 with an independent midterm review and an end of programme evaluation to inform the subsequent phase of IRIS.
